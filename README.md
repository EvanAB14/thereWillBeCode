 ## Description
 At thereWillBeCode our mission for PickUpSports is to help people unlock their creativity and to improve their physical, mental, and social health and well-being by participating in group sports and recreational activities at the community level.

 The application helps individuals and groups Create Events and Participate in sports and recreational activities in their Local areas using our uniquely powerful design platform and tireless support network. Current sports offerings include: hockey, baseball, basketball, soccer, and tennis. Current locations are in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), Toronto, Canada.

 ## User Story and How It Works
 AS A PERSON who enjoys playing community-based team sports
 I AM INTERESTED in an application that provides me with information and allows me to join specific events in my local area on a pick-up basis
 AND TO CREATE EVENTS myself that could attract like-minded players
 // how the application works
 WHEN I vist the site
 THEN I am presented with the homepage that invites me to login
 WHEN I click on the login, if I have not signed up before
 THEN I am prompted to go to a Profile page where I can create my Profile with username, password (which is hash protected), and other information about my sports interests and contact information, which can be updated and changes saved
 WHEN I then return to the homepage and login button
 THEN my saved user credentials allow me to login to the site
 WHEN I click on the ContactUs button in the navbar
 THEN I am given contact information for the PickUpSports support team
 WHEN I click on the Profile button in the navbar
 THEN I can review and update my Profile
 WHEN I click on the Events button in the navbar
 THEN I am taken to the Events page, which allows me to choose and Event in which to particpate, or to create a new Event for which I will serve as the convenor
 WHEN I review the Events available
 THEN I see that PickUp currently points to the locations of several Toronto Parks & Rec locations and facilities (see link below) and includes five sports--hockey, baseball, basketball, soccer, and tennis--and that the Event listings provide the location and the date/time of the event as well as the contact information for EventCreator/convenor
 WHEN I choose an Event in which to participate
 THEN an email is automatically sent to the convenor of that Event to indicate my interest
 WHEN I create an Event, with its location, date/time, sport, number of players sought, and description
 THEN other players can indicate their interest in joining the Event, and I am contacted automatically by email for follow-up coordination
 WHEN I logout of the site
 THEN my sessions are saved so that I can continue planning and playing from where I left off
